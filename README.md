## General Information
This case study has detailed analysis of Bike sharing. We graphically represent different possibilities of data and build a model for estimating 
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Technologies Used
  - Python
  - SkLearn
  - statsmodels
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
